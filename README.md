# Citations-Best-Practices

Created by Alice Lynn McMichael

There is a common problem with linking out to academic articles within WordPress pages and other websites, where there is not universal access to those sources. Why there is not an easy answer, below are some ideas for best practices and things to try to solve this problem.

There are two tools that may be useful. First is a new Chrome browser plug-in called "Open Access Buttion" that searches for open access (OA) versions of articles ([plug-in homepage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-access-button/gknkbkaapnhpmkcgkmdekdffgcddoiel?hl=en)). There is another tool called 'OA DOI' that looks for open access versions of articles that have a DOI (digital object identifier).

It is possible to look for versions of articles and/or books in institutional repositories where some authors place an open acces (OA) or pre-proof version. This can take some searching, but some authors mention the presence of this or give links to them on their personal website. Another way to find this type of sources is to research the author's home institution and see if it has a repository. 

As a last resort, you may want to consider doing an annotated bibliography or footnotes and/or linking to abstracts online (see [Active Citations](https://github.com/leadr-msu/active-citations)), in addition to the citation.
